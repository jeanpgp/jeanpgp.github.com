            <h2>Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
            <h3>Wed. April 21, 2021</h3>
            <p>I chose to read the article, "Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows," written
                by Naema Baskanderi. The first thing I noticed was that I was not familiar with 
                what modals are. This helped clarify that for me clearly by providing a definition. 
                I think my experience 
                with modals have been when I have clicked a page with lots of annoying advertisements advertisements
                and higher risks of viruses. Other 
                times that I remember modals are with online
                newspapers that stop me from accessing the full page without subscription
                or wthout my AdBlock turned off. I think it is interesting that Baskanderi notes that it should 
                not be used ot show warning messages. I find this ironic since a lot of spam use it 
                to show a false warning message. As I read more of the article, I realized that overlays are very common
                since a lot of log ins use overlays as well. I think her notes about the downsides of modals are
                very relatable from a user point of view. They definitely do interrupt the user experience. I think overlays and modals serve more purpose 
                to the people who own the website rather than the users themselves, since the people who made the 
                website are assuming what the user should interact with. For example, I don't have a Twitter yet I like
                sometimes view Twitter profiles. I eventually get stopped from doing so by Twitter's overlays. This benefits
                Twitter more than it benefits me as a user, because it encourages me to create an account.

            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <h3>Wed. April 14, 2021</h3>
            
            <p>Reading Ansari's article, "Best Practices for Form Design" taught me
                20 tips. I know from my own form-filling experience that 
                keeping the form short is best as I am impatient, and I think others
                can relate. I found that many of Ansari's suggestions align with
                my own preferences. Overall, there is a lot of emphasis on keeping 
                the form as simple as possible and letting the user know about their
                progress.
                
                Something I did not realized but learned by reading this article was 
                Ansari's 4th tip. Although it
                is common, I never really thought about how forms usually ask the easiest questions
                first and keep the complicated questions for later. This is a technique
                that's used in every form I have ever filled. They start by asking your
                name. However, I never realized it was to keep you invested and motivated
                in filling the form out. Also, distinguishing between optional and required
                fields is important and something I have observed. However, I would 
                not have remembered or come up with it on my own without reading about it. 
                
                I fill out a <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey"> Daily Symptom Survey</a> every day as a result of living on campus
                during the pandemic. Since it is fairly short, it does not show 
                a progress bar and all the questions are on one page. The form
                is simple by having mostly yes or no options. It exemplifies the "less is more"
                concept. It uses one column.
