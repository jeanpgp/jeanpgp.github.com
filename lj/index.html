            <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
            <h3>Tue. May 18, 2021</h3>
            <p>
                I read Amri Domri's article on UX Game Design. I think his experience and background is impressive, maybe even a little scary considering the amount of user data he had access to and  his acknowledgement that he liked affecting the human brain. Reading the tip about placing ads on the bottom where it is easiest to click was something that frustrated me considering that is one of my pet peeves as a user in mobile games. I understand that it is beneficial for the app, and it works for their objective, but personally I think it is annoying. Another takeaway is I did not realize how beneficial sliders and pop ups are until reading this article. Overall, it was interesting seeing a list of all the similarities in every mobile game I have played compiled into an article that explains why the design is how it is for these applications.

            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis Part One and Two</h2>
            <h3>Thu. May 6, 2021</h3>   
            <p>
            This image is interesting to me because it features an object that I enjoy. It is a venus fly trap that was a gift this past Christmas.
            It has grown really well, and needs to be transferred out of its vial. I enjoy looking at it and having it by my window. 
            For other people, it might just be a plant, but for me it holds many memories. The last time I had a venus fly trap
            was over 10 years ago and it did not survive the summer heat one day. This image makes me remember that first plant. It relates to my archive studio project, because it is 
            a gift from my ex-boyfriend which is what my archive will be about. It is one of the objects I still have that hold memories of us. 
            The collection tells a story about my first relationship, and I think it will be bittersweet. Hopefully it is relatable to see the small remnants of someone else in your everyday life, especially
            if that person is not as present in your life as they once were.

            Jessica's image shows a closet. I am assuming it is hers. The most interesting aspects are the variety of textures and patterns present. There is a lot going on and it is a busy image.
            There are also items above the clothes which might be significant as well. Overall, what stands out to me the most are the clothes hanging in the closet as they take 
            up the most space in the image.There is a pattern made by the clothes themselves in their repetition in the closet. They are aligned in lines creating a sense of 
            movement downwards. This image contains a lot of lines and geometric box shapes. Besides the linear movement of the clothes on the hangers, the boxes on the side and top add to the geometry of the picture.
            The most obvious parts are that this is a closet and there are clothes present. Overall, there is a sense of mystery in that no object is fully shown. Although clothes are implied, they are not laid out.

            <h2>Visual Thinking:Sssolitaire</h2>
            <h3>Thu. April 29, 2021</h3>
            <p>
            I saw <a href="https://www.sssolitaire.com/"> Sssolitaire</a> on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/"> Awwards.com</a> 
            website. I loved the images they included with the different hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs that you could 
            creat by clicking. I liked that if you added enough of those, it dropped downwards and the card image animated into a new 
            one.I liked that the cursor had the instructions on how to interact with the page. When hovering over links, 
            a scribble over the words is created. Small details like that made the website better. In contrast to the circling 
            over links, the dark mode link would be scribbled out if hovered over, reflecting the mode and point of the button. The visuals and 
            fonts work together very well. Their about page scrolls horizontally and reveals more details in pictures as you scroll.
            I found that to be very appealing.

            <h2>Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
            <h3>Wed. April 21, 2021</h3>
            <p>I chose to read the article, "Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows," written
                by Naema Baskanderi. The first thing I noticed was that I was not familiar with 
                what modals are. This helped clarify that for me clearly by providing a definition. 
                I think my experience 
                with modals have been when I have clicked a page with lots of annoying advertisements advertisements
                and higher risks of viruses. Other 
                times that I remember modals are with online
                newspapers that stop me from accessing the full page without subscription
                or wthout my AdBlock turned off. I think it is interesting that Baskanderi notes that it should 
                not be used ot show warning messages. I find this ironic since a lot of spam use it 
                to show a false warning message. As I read more of the article, I realized that overlays are very common
                since a lot of log ins use overlays as well. I think her notes about the downsides of modals are
                very relatable from a user point of view. They definitely do interrupt the user experience. I think overlays and modals serve more purpose 
                to the people who own the website rather than the users themselves, since the people who made the 
                website are assuming what the user should interact with. For example, I don't have a Twitter yet I like
                sometimes view Twitter profiles. I eventually get stopped from doing so by Twitter's overlays. This benefits
                Twitter more than it benefits me as a user, because it encourages me to create an account.

            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <h3>Wed. April 14, 2021</h3>
            
            <p>Reading Ansari's article, "Best Practices for Form Design" taught me
                20 tips. I know from my own form-filling experience that 
                keeping the form short is best as I am impatient, and I think others
                can relate. I found that many of Ansari's suggestions align with
                my own preferences. Overall, there is a lot of emphasis on keeping 
                the form as simple as possible and letting the user know about their
                progress.
                
                Something I did not realized but learned by reading this article was 
                Ansari's 4th tip. Although it
                is common, I never really thought about how forms usually ask the easiest questions
                first and keep the complicated questions for later. This is a technique
                that's used in every form I have ever filled. They start by asking your
                name. However, I never realized it was to keep you invested and motivated
                in filling the form out. Also, distinguishing between optional and required
                fields is important and something I have observed. However, I would 
                not have remembered or come up with it on my own without reading about it. 
                
                I fill out a <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey"> Daily Symptom Survey</a> every day as a result of living on campus
                during the pandemic. Since it is fairly short, it does not show 
                a progress bar and all the questions are on one page. The form
                is simple by having mostly yes or no options. It exemplifies the "less is more"
                concept. It uses one column.
