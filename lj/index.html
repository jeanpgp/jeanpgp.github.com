            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <h3>Wed. April 14, 2021</h3>
            
            <p>Reading Ansari's article, "Best Practices for Form Design" taught me
                20 tips. I know from my own form-filling experience that 
                keeping the form short is best as I am impatient, and I think others
                can relate. I found that many of Ansari's suggestions align with
                my own preferences. Overall, there is a lot of emphasis on keeping 
                the form as simple as possible and letting the user know about their
                progress.
                
                Something I did not realized but learned by reading this article was 
                Ansari's 4th tip. Although it
                is common, I never really thought about how forms usually ask the easiest questions
                first and keep the complicated questions for later. This is a technique
                that's used in every form I have ever filled. They start by asking your
                name. However, I never realized it was to keep you invested and motivated
                in filling the form out. Also, distinguishing between optional and required
                fields is important and something I have observed. However, I would 
                not have remembered or come up with it on my own without reading about it. 
                
                I fill out a <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey"> Daily Symptom Survey</a> every day as a result of living on campus
                during the pandemic. Since it is fairly short, it does not show 
                a progress bar and all the questions are on one page. The form
                is simple by having mostly yes or no options. It exemplifies the "less is more"
                concept. It uses one column.
