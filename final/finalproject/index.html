            into those phases that have made me who I am today.

    <h3>2009 - 2011</h3>
    <p>My earliest memory is watching the first Harry Potter movie when I was about 2 or 3 years old. I remember telling myself in my head that
        I wanted to watch the scene where he swallows the snitch and that I would stay in front of the television until that scene, then leave afterwards. I grew up with 4 older sisters 
        who were the targetted age for Harry Potter as it was coming out. I started reading the books at 8 years old, and stayed in my Harry Potter phase until the last movie came out in 2011.
        Harry Potter was a big part of my entire family's childhood and we have a shared love for it. 
        Growing up on Harry Potter fueled my imagination and allowed me to escape through books. I think it allowed me to find comfort in escapism, and I find that I still
        do that to this day, perhaps, dangerously, through my phone primarily.

        <h3>2012 - 2014</h3>
        <p>I watched a lot of YouTube vloggers during middle school. I think 
            being raised in that culture benefitted my ideologies. It allowed me to have a 
            lot of LGBT+ and POC representation that was not mainstream in other media at the time. 
            I think that is one of the many benefits of an internet-ruled media. Content and entertainment
            are more accessible to anyone than ever before.

        <h3>2013 - 2015</h3>
        <p>I was obsessed with One Direction. I think it shaped a lot of my music taste. 
            Additionally, my obsession with One Direction led me to create a Tumblr blog dedicated to them. This was my first introduction to HTML and CSS.
            I spent hours customizing my Tumblr page. In a way, my One Direction phase led to me coding. Now I'm in college for Computer Science and also taking DES 157, utilizing 
            the HTML and CSS I originally learned back when I was 12 and trying to create a more attractive blog for my One Direction obsession.

        <h3>2018 - 2021</h3>
        <p>I'm not saying Timothee Chalamet is the sole reason I am at UC Davis but perhaps he was a contributing factor. My New Year's resolution in 2018 was to focus on myself 
            instead of random celebrities or fandoms. On January 2nd, 2018, I discovered Timothee Chalamet and my resolution ended very quickly.
             One of the movies he's in, Ladybird, centers around Sacramento. UC Davis is a significant element in the movie. The movie is an homage to the Sacramento area, and it made me 
             appreciate the central valley area overall.

            These interests have allowed me to bloom and grow as an indiviudal. I believe that
            everything we do creates a butterfly effect that affects who we are as people. What about you?
            I urge you to reflect on how your interests have led to the person you are today.

        <h3>2019 - 2021</h3>
        <p>I had a late Lizzie McGuire phase even though I was way too old. Somehow, even though I was too young to actually remember when the show came out, 
            I still feel nostalgic when I watch it. Going through this developed my style and fashion sense. Nowadays, I am tempted to buy any piece of colorful clothing that
            looks like it is straight of the early 2000s.
