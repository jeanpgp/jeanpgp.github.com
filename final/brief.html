        <h1>Project Brief</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p> 
            I am updating my Every Picture Studio Project 2, which displayed images of items that reminded me of my past relationship and explained the stories behind them.

            <p>
                This website is similar to my final project in its interaction with the certain images on the page. I like that the cursor is relevant to the 
                overall theme of the page. The animation during the hover is also fun and fits the expected animation of what a plant may do. I love how the name of 
                the website is embedded in the art of the page. In the graphic elements, some parts stand out while other parts are purposely made flatter to seem 
                part of the background and hone in on the idea that they are not interactive features. However, I do think the plants being clickable and going to another page or set of information would be nice.

                I really like the extreemly interactive and animated aspects of this website. This is something I want to implement in my final project. I want each click and interaction to really
                create an experience that takes the user somewhere else and delves into a story. I get that the 
                animated tree at the bottom of each page lets the user know how much of the article they have read, but personally, I feel like that information
                could have been presented better, because I did not really understand what it was for right away. I like that the scrolling from the top page to the second half is a little uneven on the border.

            </p>
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p> 
                My project will be similar to How Many Plants in that I want a cursor that fits thematically with the page. I want certain graphic elemtns to have
                animations when hovered over as well. I want my final to be similar to Climber by having clicking an image transport the page completely so that it delves into a completely different
                interface altogether. For this project, I want each story that the image tells to be more interactive and transform the page, maybe taking the 
                user into the story rather than having them just read about it on the polaroid overlays the original studio had. 
            </p>
            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                For the design, I want it to be symmetrical to be aesthetically pleasing. Interactions
                that are similar will have graphic elements that are similar too in order to convey the idea
                that the user should expect those elements to behave like each other. I want to continue what I did in the 
                studio project where it had a scrapbook/ journal/ collage -feel. I want it to feel highly analog in a digital interface.  
                I also want to add more sticker-like images to give it a childlike or immature feel, because I feel like the idea of a scrapbook about a heartbreak is immature 
                in itself. Other than the project comparisons, I think the page <a href="https://www.oliviarodrigo.com/">https://www.oliviarodrigo.com/</a> has design themes that I also 
                think are inspirational. Her webpage has a scrapbook-feel as well. I like the light color palette that the studio had and so I will probably keep it like that. I like that it is colorful despite the gravestone.
                I am also taking inspiration from the show, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Daisies">"Pushing Daisies"</a>, which has thematic elements revolving death but the cinematography is very cute and colorful. I 
                also want to add a favicon as I have not included one yet. 
            </p>
            <h2> Interaction Strategies</h2> 
            <p>
                I want to integrate audio into the final project, perhaps through songs that we used to listen to. I am not entirely sure how I will implement it yet since I don't want it to be too
                intrusive to the user, but I think it would a valuable item to add. Additionally, I am planning on asking the user for their name first and if it is the name 
                of my ex, it would show a different page, either by showing the same content, but different story captions or just not letting them view it at all or create a unique message for them. I also 
                want to add a cursor that changes when you hover over an interactive image. I am thinking of doing a broken heart that comes together when hovered over an image that has a story memory.

            </p>
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2> 
            <p>
                I think for this project I really want the user to be transformed. I think clicking an image should completely change the entire view.
                I am thinking of honing in on the scrapbook idea by making it seem like you opened a new page in a book when you click a memory. I want to create
                more animations as part of that goal. I am also considering making the page feel more bittersweet, so maybe the stories within it may be more serious to create a more
                emotional response for the user. I think it might be a more powerful experience if I did.
